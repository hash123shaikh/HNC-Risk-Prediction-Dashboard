# 🧠 HNC-Risk-Prediction-Dashboard

A lightweight, in-house web dashboard for **Head and Neck Cancer (HNC)** risk prediction using radiomics and clinical data. This tool enables clinicians and researchers to visualize top-5 radiomics features, explore patient-level clinical data, and obtain real-time risk scores from a trained machine learning model—all securely hosted within institutional infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard bridges radiomics research with clinical utility. It offers:

- A **patient lookup** system by ID
- A **tabular view of clinical features**
- A **visual representation of radiomics features**
- A **real-time risk score** for recurrence prediction

All operations run locally within a Dockerized environment to ensure compliance with data privacy policies.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Patient Lookup** – Quickly search by ID
- 📋 **Clinical Data Table** – View demographics & treatment summary
- 📊 **Radiomics Visualization** – Horizontal bar chart of top-5 features
- 🧠 **Risk Score** – Real-time recurrence prediction via scikit-learn
- 🌐 **RESTful API** – Built with FastAPI, supports health checks and prediction endpoints
- 🧪 **Modular ETL Pipeline** – Merge & validate clinical + radiomics data nightly
- 🖥️ **React Frontend** – Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS
- 🐳 **Docker-First Architecture** – Reproducible deployment using Docker Compose

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.8+ (for local testing)
- CSV files: `clinical.csv` and `radiomics.csv` stored in `data/`
- Pre-trained model: `model.pkl` and `feature_metadata.json`

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/HNC-Risk-Prediction-Dashboard.git
cd HNC-Risk-Prediction-Dashboard

# 2. Start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📤 API Endpoints

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `/health`        | GET    | API health check                |
| `/patients/{id}` | GET    | Fetch clinical + radiomics data |
| `/predict/{id}`  | POST   | Return risk score prediction    |


---

## ✅ Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests for API and ETL
pytest api/tests/
pytest etl/tests/
```

---

## 🏁 Deployment

For production:

- Build static React assets with `npm run build`
- Serve via NGINX with `/api` proxied to backend
- Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` with volume mounts and restart policies

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- Fully on-premise deployment (no external cloud services)
- HTTPS & optional authentication via NGINX
- Input sanitization and error handling implemented
- Institutional data privacy policies respected

- [Requirements Analysis](Requirements Analysis_ Risk Prediction Dashboard.docx)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Designed for HNC recurrence prediction using explainable radiomics biomarkers
- New models can be deployed by replacing `model.pkl` and updating metadata
- Schema changes in CSVs should be reflected in `etl/schema/patient_schema.json`
